# vrwander
This system is based on HTML5 technology, and is developed on the basis of open source project Pannellum. It realizes two major functions: scene and hotspot. Scene module realizes panorama browsing, rotation, zooming and VR mode; Hotspot module realizes panorama switching and text, link, picture and video annotation functions. In terms of data configuration and management, we can edit the hot data in WYSIWYG mode directly in panorama interface, and manage the scene and hot data in intuitive form. The system uses cylindrical projection to browse panorama stereoscopically, and chooses some scenes of Nanchang University as implementation points. Its main function is realized by calling and extending Pannellum interface. The back end uses SSH framework, uses Maven to manage dependency packages, and stores data in MySql database. In the process of implementation, the system pays attention to user experience and optimizes it in many scenarios.
